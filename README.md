Comic Sonic — the pillows
learn Comic Sonic together, word by word.
This is an interactive study guide that breaks down every word in the song with text-to-speech. Tap the left button to hear the Japanese pronunciation, tap the right to hear what it means in English. Particles get their own explanation so you understand how the sentence fits together.

My Suggested Flow For Using It
Play Comic Sonic on Apple Music (which now shows lyrics with romaji), then pause and drill each word with this guide. Works great while walking, running, or on the go.
To add the guide to your home screen, open the link in Safari and tap Share → Add to Home Screen. It runs full screen like an app. The default voices are based on the web browswer being used. 
Action Button Setup (iPhone 15 Pro+)
Set your Action Button to pause/play music so you never have to leave the guide. Feel free to use the shortcut I have included.
Step 1 — Create the shortcut

Open the Shortcuts app
Tap + to create a new shortcut
Add action: Play/Pause on iPhone
Add action: Seek Backward By 2.5 seconds on iPhone
Name it "Play/Pause"

The seek backward step is optional but nice — when you pause, it rewinds a little so you hear the line again when you resume.
Step 2 — Bind it to the Action Button

Open Settings → Action Button
Swipe to Shortcut
Select your "Play/Pause" shortcut

Now you can pause the song, drill words, and resume with one button press.
